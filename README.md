# Attention-Is-All-You-Need
A transformer neural network build from sratch by following the paper "Attention Is All You Need", and also trained and tested it to translate sentences from English to German.

Due to limited hardware resources I was not able to fully train a proper model as shown in the original paper, but I've still uploaded my trained model since it does a decent job with words it has learned from the dataset.
The settings used in this model do not match the ones in the paper due to computetional power however, the settings for the original paper are written in comments throughout the training script.
